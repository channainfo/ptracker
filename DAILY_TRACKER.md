## 🚨 Daily Focus Guardrails

### ✅ DO (MVP Aligned)
- Focus on core user value
- Build minimum viable features first
- Keep scope tight and focused
- Test each feature thoroughly
- Document as you go

### ❌ DON'T (Scope Creep)
- Add "nice-to-have" features
- Over-engineer solutions
- Perfect non-critical UI elements
- Build features for "future phases"
- Skip testing to move faster

### 🤔 ASK YOURSELF
Before starting any task:
1. "Is this required for MVP launch?"
2. "Does this solve a core user problem?"
3. "Can I build a simpler version first?"
4. "Will this block other MVP features?"
